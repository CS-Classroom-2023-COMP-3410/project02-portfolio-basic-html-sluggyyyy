            <p>
                <strong>Fair Districting Analysis | Python</strong><br>
                Analyzes election data to calculate wasted votes and the efficiency gap to measure gerrymandering in US House elections.<br>
                Parses a dataset of election results from 1976-2020 and implements the efficiency gap algorithm to quantify the extent of gerrymandering.

            <p>
                <strong>Malicious Hangman | Python</strong><br>
                A version of Hangman where the program actively tries to win by keeping the word a secret for as long as possible, 
                changing it as the user guesses letters.<br>
                Maintains a list of possible words and with each guess chooses the largest family of words that fit the current pattern, 
                delaying the choice of a final word until only one option remains.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Simple Shell | Python</strong><br>
                Simulates a simple file system and shell with basic commands like ls, cd, mkdir, rm, and pwd.<br>
                Uses a tree data structure to represent the file system hierarchy and serializes the file system state to a binary 
                file for persistence.
