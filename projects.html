        <h2>Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science - Project and Work Portfolio</h2>
        
        <h3>About This Portfolio</h3>
        <p>
            The repository linked on the Github Page represents a curated collection of projects I developed during my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. 
            Each project showcases a different aspect of my learning journey—from algorithm analysis and small game development to 
            complex simulations and data modeling. My learning throughout this program was focused on the building of practical, 
            interactive applications that demonstrate core principles of computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also included are all of my labs, homework, miscellaneous review files, and classwork!
        </p>

        <h3>Projects</h3>

        <h3>Algorithm Insight</h3>
        <p>
            A program designed to analyze the complexity and performance of different algorithms, including sorting, searching, 
            and optimization methods. It includes complexity comparisons and runtime evaluations.
        </p>

        <h3>Percolation Pathfinder</h3>
        <p>
            This project simulates the spread of fire through a forest to determine if a full spread path exists. It graphically 
            demonstrates how different densities of trees impact the probability of complete ignition.
        </p>

        <h3>Retro Snake Game</h3>
        <p>
            A recreation of the classic Snake game, implemented with simple graphics and collision detection. The game supports 
            real-time movement and collision-based game-over conditions.
        </p>

        <h3>Conga Line Simulator</h3>
        <p>
            A simulation representing a Conga Line, demonstrating the principles of classes and lists of objects where each 
            object represents a circle in the line.
        </p>

        <h3>Pico Fermi Bagels</h3>
        <p>
            A guessing game where the player tries to guess a secret number based on the hints 'Pico', 'Fermi', and 'Bagels' 
            that indicate how close their guess is.
        </p>

        <h3>Sand Game</h3>
        <p>
            A physics simulation that models the behavior of sand particles falling, colliding, and interacting with other 
            elements in a grid-based environment.
        </p>

        <h3>Fair Districting Visualizer</h3>
        <p>
            A project that attempts to model fair districting for electoral purposes, using graph theory and clustering 
            techniques to evaluate district boundaries.
        </p>

        <h3>Particle Playground</h3>
        <p>
            A particle simulation that includes various types of particles with different behaviors, such as acceleration, 
            bouncing, and color-changing effects. It also supports firework-like displays and interactive elements.
        </p>

        <h3>Wordle Remix</h3>
        <p>
            A Wordle-like game where the user attempts to guess a five-letter word within six tries. The game provides 
            color-coded feedback (green, yellow, gray) to indicate correctness and letter positioning.
